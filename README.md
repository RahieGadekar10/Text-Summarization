# Text Summarization Using Simple-Transformers

Text Summarization summarization is the process of shortening a set of data computationally, to create a subset that represents the most important or relevant information within the original content. 
The Text Summarization model is a Transformer based model built using Simple Transformer which takes a textual paragraph as an input and outputs a summary of that paragraph. This works by first 
converting the textual sentences into their repective embeddings with the help of tokenizers. 
In this case we have made use of T5 transformer and tokenizer for summarizing the text. It makes use of the HuggingFace pipeline to display the result.
